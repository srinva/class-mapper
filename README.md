# Class Mapper

## Inspiration

With the majority of the population using cars to commute to work or school daily, carbon monoxide emissions and other toxic elements are increasingly affecting the environment and air quality. Nobody can argue with the convenience of using motor vehicles for transportation - but biking, walking, and taking public transit are much better options for the environment. For many commuting college students, these options can be difficult to plan out - especially with the ease of driving a car to class. What if there was a software solution that streamlined the process of finding environmentally friendly routes to your classes?

## What it does

With Class Mapper, you are able to enter in all your classes and display all the biking, walking, and transit routes between the two locations. Class Mapper streamlines the process of finding sustainable routes to your daily classes - no excuses now! Start using Class Mapper and help the environment today!

## How we built it

We built our app using React and Node.js along with Google Cloud's Google Maps Embed API in order to display the maps dynamically for all the classes which were added in.

## Challenges we ran into

Some of the hardest parts of this project involved syncing up the embedded maps with the proper directions since this was an API we had never used before. Additionally, with both of us having minimal React experience, we learned a lot about how React works fundamentally.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are quite proud of our finished product since it works pretty smoothly and displays the directions as intended. Using technologies we had both never used much before, we managed to put together a product good enough to showcase in the span of 24 hours.

## What we learned

We both learned a lot about React and Google Cloud's API service. We are both excited to use this knowledge in future projects.

## What's next for Class Mapper

There are many more possibilities for Class Mapper still - calculating the most environmentally friendly route, automatically bringing the fastest route to the top of your view, and exporting any given route's directions are some features that we want to add in the future.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
